## General info

A website designed in Markups and JavaScript. Bootstrap, jQuery and a little bit of Vanilla JS were used in the application.
I also implemented modal dialogs with bookings and voucher purchase system. The website contains a game created in JavaScript.

## Tech info

- The Vinyl shop website was written in **React**. I used **Context API** for better data flow in application.
- In a project, I wanted to learn content flow and how to build simple e-commerce website with modal shopping details, product details and full functional basket. Also I learned how to use Styled Components to style app directly in React components.

## Technologies

- Vanilla Javascript
- Markups
- Sassy CSS
- Context API
- Jest
